# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
Programs written for the course Data Structures and Algorithms (laboratory) at the Wroclaw University of Science and Technology (Politechnika Wroclawska)

1. List 1 - Basic iterators and writing to a file
2. List 2 - Iterators
3. List 3 - Queues and stacks
4. List 4 - Linked lists
5. List 5-7 - Sorting algorithms
6. List 8 - Heaps
7. List 9 - Hash tables
8. List 10 - BST (Binary Search Tree)
9. List 11 - RB Tree (Red-Black Tree) and 2-3-4 Tree
10. List 12 - Disjoint-set Data Structure and the analysis of trees from the list 10 and 11
11. List 13 - Graphs, BFS (Breadth-First Search), DFS (Depth-First Search)
12. List 14 - Graphs, Kruskal's algorithm, Prim's algorithm, Floyd-Warshall algorithm
13. List 15 - Huffman Coding

The detailed description of the tasks is in the folder Tasks (in Polish language)

Notes about list 1 and list 15 (because they don't have a file with a detailed task descryption):
1. List 1 is very similar to list 2 but without the advanced usage of iterators
2. List 15 is only a basic Huffman Coding implementation
